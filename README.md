# FAST-IR

## *Analyzing fNIRS data in Matlab*

> Functional Analysis Scripting Tool - InfraRed loads fNIRS data files to analyse brain activity. The tool enables you to efficiently read and process data files in NIRX-supported file formats.

## Usage

The matlab code is rather easy to use, however, you need to have the Brain AnalyzIR toolbox installed. The file `fnirs_analysis_script.m` is the main script that calls on the other scripts and functions in the PhD_EEG_Pipeline folder. Simply run the file

```
fnirs_analysis_script
```

## Technologies Used

- Matlab - successfully tested in version 2023a
